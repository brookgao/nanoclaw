# Managing Groups

> Main 群组管理操作手册：查找、注册、配置、删除、列出已注册群组。

## Finding Available Groups

Available groups are provided in `/workspace/ipc/available_groups.json`:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "jid": "120363336345536173@g.us",
      "name": "Family Chat",
      "lastActivity": "2026-01-31T12:00:00.000Z",
      "isRegistered": false
    }
  ],
  "lastSync": "2026-01-31T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Groups are ordered by most recent activity. The list is synced from the channel daily.

If a group the user mentions isn't in the list, request a fresh sync:

```bash
echo '{"type": "refresh_groups"}' > /workspace/ipc/tasks/refresh_$(date +%s).json
```

Then wait a moment and re-read `available_groups.json`.

**Fallback**: Query the SQLite database directly:

```bash
sqlite3 /workspace/project/store/messages.db "
  SELECT jid, name, last_message_time
  FROM chats
  WHERE jid LIKE '%@g.us' AND jid != '__group_sync__'
  ORDER BY last_message_time DESC
  LIMIT 10;
"
```

## Registered Groups Config

Groups are registered in the SQLite `registered_groups` table:

```json
{
  "1234567890-1234567890@g.us": {
    "name": "Family Chat",
    "folder": "whatsapp_family-chat",
    "trigger": "@Andy",
    "added_at": "2024-01-31T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Fields:
- **Key**: chat JID (unique identifier — WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, etc.)
- **name**: Display name for the group
- **folder**: Channel-prefixed folder name under `groups/`
- **trigger**: Trigger word (usually same as global, but could differ)
- **requiresTrigger**: Whether `@trigger` prefix needed (default: `true`). Set `false` for solo chats where all messages should process
- **isMain**: Whether this is the main control group (elevated privileges, no trigger required)
- **added_at**: ISO timestamp when registered

## Trigger Behavior

- **Main group** (`isMain: true`): No trigger needed — all messages processed automatically
- **Groups with `requiresTrigger: false`**: No trigger needed — all messages processed (1-on-1 or solo chats)
- **Other groups** (default): Messages must start with `@AssistantName` to be processed

## Adding a Group

1. Query the database to find the group's JID
2. Ask the user whether the group should require a trigger word before registering
3. Use the `register_group` MCP tool with the JID, name, folder, trigger, and chosen `requiresTrigger`
4. Optionally include `containerConfig` for additional mounts
5. Group folder is created automatically: `/workspace/project/groups/{folder-name}/`
6. Optionally create an initial `CLAUDE.md` for the group

Folder naming convention — channel prefix with underscore separator:
- WhatsApp "Family Chat" → `whatsapp_family-chat`
- Telegram "Dev Team" → `telegram_dev-team`
- Discord "General" → `discord_general`
- Slack "Engineering" → `slack_engineering`
- Use lowercase, hyphens for the group name part

### Adding Additional Directories for a Group

Groups can have extra directories mounted. Add `containerConfig` to their entry:

```json
{
  "1234567890@g.us": {
    "name": "Dev Team",
    "folder": "dev-team",
    "trigger": "@Andy",
    "added_at": "2026-01-31T12:00:00Z",
    "containerConfig": {
      "additionalMounts": [
        {
          "hostPath": "~/projects/webapp",
          "containerPath": "webapp",
          "readonly": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The directory will appear at `/workspace/extra/webapp` in that group's container.

### Sender Allowlist

After registering a group, explain the sender allowlist feature to the user:

> This group can be configured with a sender allowlist to control who can interact with me. Two modes:
>
> - **Trigger mode** (default): Everyone's messages are stored for context, but only allowed senders can trigger me with @{AssistantName}.
> - **Drop mode**: Messages from non-allowed senders not stored at all.
>
> For closed groups with trusted members, I recommend setting up an allow-only list so only specific people can trigger me. Want me to configure that?

If the user wants an allowlist, edit `~/.config/nanoclaw/sender-allowlist.json` on the host:

```json
{
  "default": { "allow": "*", "mode": "trigger" },
  "chats": {
    "<chat-jid>": {
      "allow": ["sender-id-1", "sender-id-2"],
      "mode": "trigger"
    }
  },
  "logDenied": true
}
```

Notes:
- Your own messages (`is_from_me`) bypass allowlist in trigger checks. Bot messages filtered before trigger evaluation, so never reach allowlist.
- If config file doesn't exist or is invalid, all senders allowed (fail-open)
- Config file lives on host at `~/.config/nanoclaw/sender-allowlist.json`, not inside container

## Removing a Group

1. Read `/workspace/project/data/registered_groups.json`
2. Remove the entry for that group
3. Write the updated JSON back
4. Group folder and its files remain (don't delete them)

## Listing Groups

Read `/workspace/project/data/registered_groups.json` and format it nicely.

## Scheduling for Other Groups

When scheduling tasks for other groups, use `target_group_jid` parameter with the group's JID from `registered_groups.json`:

```
schedule_task(
  prompt: "...",
  schedule_type: "cron",
  schedule_value: "0 9 * * 1",
  target_group_jid: "120363336345536173@g.us"
)
```

The task runs in that group's context with access to their files and memory.
